# e-paper75

This code is under construction.

I stopped working on this due to the fact that Waveshare e-paper displays do not work so well with information that regularly needs to be refreshed. When the display is refreshing it blinks a couple of times and it is really annoying.Now I will use the display for information that does not need to be refreshed so often......
